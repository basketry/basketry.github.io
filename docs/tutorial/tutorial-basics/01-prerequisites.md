# Prerequisites

## Node Project

This guide assumes that you already have a NodeJS project initialized. While Basketry can generate code for any languge, it does do so using NPM packages, so a `package.json` file is required. This guide assumes that you already have initialized a NodeJS project.

## Package managers

In this guide, we'll talk about installing NPM packages and creating and running scripts. We assume that you already have a working knowledge of NPM or Yarn and know how to use your preferred package manager to perform those actions.

## Typescript

Lastly, this guide will demonstrate building a service in Typescript. We assumes that you are either familiar with setting up a new project with Typescript installed or have access to an existing project with it ready to go.
