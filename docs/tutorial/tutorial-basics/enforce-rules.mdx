# Enforce Rules

Use rules to create consistency in your service design.

## Rules

You can use rules to enforce naming conventions, check for required fields, and more. Basketry comes with a set of built-in rules, or you can create your own custom ones.

Let's start by installing the `@basketry/rules` package:

<Tabs groupId="package-manager">
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>

```sh
npm install @basketry/rules
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

```sh
yarn add @basketry/rules
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">

```sh
pnpm add @basketry/rules
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Update the configuration

Update the `rules` property in your `basketry.config.json` file to include the `@basketry/rules` package:

```json title="basketry.config.json"
{
  "source": "petstore.json",
  "parser": "@basketry/openapi-3",
  "rules": ["@basketry/rules"],
  "generators": ["@basketry/typescript"],
  "output": "src",
  "options": {
    "basketry": {}
  }
}
```

<Tabs groupId="package-manager">
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>

```sh
npm run basketry
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

```sh
yarn basketry
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">

```sh
pnpm run basketry
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Your `src` directory (the `output` specified in `basketry.config.json`) should now contain TypeScript files that represent your OpenAPI service definition. You can now use these files in your project!

Next, let's add some rules to enforce consistency in our service design.
