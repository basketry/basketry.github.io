description: Generate Petstore types and interfaces in TypeScript

import { Install } from "@site/src/components/package-manager";

# Add a Generator

## TypeScript

We want to generate TypeScript types and interfaces that represent our source service definition. We'll continue by installing the `@basketry/typescript` generator:

<Install package="@basketry/typescript" />

## Update the configuration

Update the `generators` property in your `basketry.config.json` file to include the `@basketry/typescript` generator. Also update the `output` property to point to the directory where you want to save the generated files:

```json title="basketry.config.json"
{
  "source": "petstore.json",
  "parser": "@basketry/openapi-3",
  "rules": [],
  "generators": ["@basketry/typescript"],
  "output": "src",
  "options": {
    "basketry": {}
  }
}
```

:::info

Learn more about the generators that Basketry provides by checking out the [generator components](/docs/components/generators).

At this point we have a servicer definition with a matching parser and generator. Next, we'll create a script to generate some code!
