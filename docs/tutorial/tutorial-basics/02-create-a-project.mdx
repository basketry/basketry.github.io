# Create a Project

## Install the Basketry CLI:

The Basketry CLI is the main tool for creating and running a Basketry project. Install the `basketry` package to get started.

<Install package="basketry" />

## Initialize the project

Run the `init` command to create a new Basketry project:

<Exec command="basketry init" />

This will create a `basketry.config.json` file in the root of your project:

```json title="basketry.config.json"
{
  "source": "",
  "parser": "",
  "rules": [],
  "generators": [],
  "output": "",
  "options": {
    "basketry": {}
  }
}
```
