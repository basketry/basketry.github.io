## Node Project

## Package managers

In this guide, we'll talk about installing NPM packages and creating and running scripts. We assume that you already have a working knowledge of NPM or Yarn and know how to use your preferred package manager to perform those actions.

[Getting started with NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started)

[Getting started with Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/getting-started/)

## Typescript

Lastly, this guide will demonstrate building a service in Typescript. We assumes that you are either familiar with setting up a new project or have access to an existing project.

Visit https://www.typescriptlang.org/download/ for the official docs on setting up Typescript in your project. If you want to use the Typescript project scaffolding tool that were used to create the example projects, use the [generator-ts-console](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-ts-console) Yeoman generator.
