## Install

:::info

This generator is a prerelease and may have breaking changes in future versions.

:::

<Install package="@basketry/react-query@alpha" />

## Basic Usage

```json title="basketry.config.json"
{
  "source": "petstore.json",
  "parser": "@basketry/openapi-3",
  "generators": ["@basketry/react-query"],
  "output": "src"
}
```

## File Structure

This generator will create [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/overview) schemas for all the API schemas defined in the source file.

By default, the file will be nested within a directory named after the API major version. This behavior can be disabled by using the `includeVersion` option from the [Typescript Generator](/docs/components/@basketry/typescript#includeversion).

## Options

This generator depends on the `@basketry/typescript` generator and all of their applied options will also apply to files emitted by this generator.

See:

- `@basketry/typescript` [options](/docs/components/@basketry/typescript#options)

The `@basketry/react-query` generator does not accept any of its own options.

## Dependencies

The generated file contains code that depends on the `@tanstack/react-query` package that is not included by default. You will need to install it separately.

<Install package="@tanstack/react-query" />
