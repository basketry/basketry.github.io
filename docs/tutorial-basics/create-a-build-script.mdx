# Create a Build Script

## Package.json

Add a `basketry` script to your `package.json` file that runs the Basketry CLI:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "scripts": {
    "basketry": "basketry"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@basketry/openapi-3": "^0.1.0",
    "@basketry/typescript": "^0.1.0"
  }
}
```

Now you can run the `basketry` script to generate code from your service definition:

<Tabs groupId="package-manager">
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>

```sh
npm run basketry
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

```sh
yarn basketry
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">

```sh
pnpm run basketry
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Your `src` directory (the `output` specified in `basketry.config.json`) should now contain TypeScript files that represent your OpenAPI service definition. You can now use these files in your project!

Next, let's add some rules to enforce consistency in our service design.
